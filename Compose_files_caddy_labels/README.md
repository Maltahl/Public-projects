A curated list of Docker Compose yaml files for my production.

This version contains changes required to run a more automated version of Caddy Reverse Proxy with Docker Compose Labels that can be adapted for Kubernetes.

These yaml files provide a solid foundation for the home lab and has some points of automation that will be improved as time passes on.

Note The following yaml files are intended for use in local 1 Server environments such as homelab setups, tinkering with software stacks, etc. 
These files should not be deployed in commercial production environments, if deployed in production, there is no help or support and you sign away rights to sue me for damages that directly/indirectly attributed from using these compose files for production enviroment.

Enviroment based on Kubernetes (RKE2) is getting worked on.
